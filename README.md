# Lazily evaluated tree

Sometimes, you need to traverse a tree so large that you can't afford to load it all into memory.  This is a simple library that allows you to do that.

By implementing the Node trait and creating a new Tree, you can traverse in a lazy fashion.

See the examples directory for more information.
